# OFDR Community Missions
### A collaborative effort
Community collaboration on Operation Flashpoint Dragon Rising missions, spearheaded by tvig0r0us.


## Setup
To use this repository, clone it directly into your Operation Flashpoint Dragon Rising game directory. Then go to the "Mission Editor" folder in your game directory. Select all and copy into the cloned repository. When prompted, ignore files that already exist. This will give you a complete editing environment that includes the included Mission Editor Expansion with all syntax highlighting and auto complete in the editor. When you launch the editor to work on a community project, simply launch the editor in the community missions repository folder instead of the normal mission editor. This preserves your entire set up and enables you to develop in the community project regardless of any customizations you might have for your own editing environment.
