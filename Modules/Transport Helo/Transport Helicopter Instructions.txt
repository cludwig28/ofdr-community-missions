OFDR Transport Helicopter Module by tvig0r0us
To use the transport helicopter module simply extract the transport helo folder to a location of your choice on your computer.
You will need to import the module into the project.
To do this, simply open the editor.
Load your project.
Go to the file menu option and go to "Marker Collection".
Select "Load".
Navigate to the transport helo folder you extracted from the zip and select the "Transport Helicopter Module.markerscollection.xml".
You should now have the script and all of the entity sets required to use the transport helicopter in your mission.
In this case the camera functions have been incorporated into the autocomplete and can be accessed from your script under the prefix EDX.
A list will appear with all of the commands that are available from the transport helo script.

For an example featuring the use of the transport helicopter menu see the "transportHelo2.mssn"
