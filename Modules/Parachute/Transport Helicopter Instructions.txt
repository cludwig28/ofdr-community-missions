OFDR Parachute Module by tvig0r0us
To use the Parachute Module simply extract the parachute folder to a location of your choice on your computer.
You will need to import the module into the project.
To do this, simply open the editor.
Load your project.
Go to the file menu option and go to "Marker Collection".
Select "Load".
Navigate to the transport helo folder you extracted from the zip and select the "Parachute Module.markerscollection.xml".
You should now have the script and all of the entity sets required to use the Parachute Module in your mission.

To make any soldier parachute to the ground when dismounting an airborne helicopter simply select the soldier, go to the modify tab, 
find groups and add the soldier to a group called "chutegroup".  Do this for each soldier you want to use the parachute.


For an example featuring the use of the Parachute Module see the "transportHelo2.mssn"

Transport Helicopter Events

onParachuteInitialized() --fires after the parachute script is completely initialized.  It's recommended to wait until this function fires before doing anything else in your mission as the initialization process is very intensive.
